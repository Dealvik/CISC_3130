You can change how many songs to "listen" to. This deletes from a playlist which then adds the deleted songs to a Stack.

The stack then prints out in the correct order from which you "listened" to.

You can also change how many songs you "listen" to with the " SONGS_TO_LISTEN_TO " variable.

*There are no duplicates in the playlist and it is also sorted.*
